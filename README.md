### Goal
Playing around with Event Driven Architectures is hard! The goal of this project is to simplify playing around with EDAs - and to use technologies, best practices and approaches that may easily be extrapolated to a production-ready state. 

## So, what's in here?
Everything is based on Docker, so basically we boot a lot of stuff on startup via docker-compose. Let's have a deeper look. There is
### Kafka and Zookeeper
If you do EDA the messaging way you need a broker. A broker that's able to replay messages, that has persistent messages, a broker that's scalable and highly available - in short: you need Kafka. 
### Jenkins, Sonar and Nexus
We included a build and deployment pipeline. Jobs are added to Jenkins via Job DSL, which creates CI-, Sonar- and Docker-Build-and-Deployment-Jobs for each microservice specified in one simple configuration file (https://github.com/codecentric/event-driven-microservices-platform-config/blob/master/edmp-project-configuration.json). That way you just create a Maven-based microservice in a new Github repository, add it to the configuration file above and our Jenkins-Job-DSL-Seedjob will pick it up, create jobs for it and deploy it on every change.
### Spring Boot Admin
If the microservice happens to be a Spring Boot based microservice, it can be automatically registered in our always running Spring Boot Admin instance for easy monitoring.
### Spring Cloud Config Server
Spring Cloud Config exposes a Github repository as a central place for configuration data, and that data can be consumed via a REST API. Of course, if you're using Spring Boot, there's a convenient way to consume this data via a special Spring Boot starter.
### Sample apps
There are three sample apps to get you started - two Spring Cloud Stream applications that write / read to / from Kafka, and one standalone application that uses its own private Redis. These sample apps are not started by docker-compose but by automatically generated Jenkins jobs.

## Prerequisites (Mac)

You should have Docker Toolbox installed, see https://www.docker.com/toolbox

I am using docker-compose to start several docker container at once.
Since all containers run in a single VM (virtualbox), this VM needs enough memory.

### Step 0 - Check Docker Machine version

Ensure that you are using version 0.3.0 or greater of `docker-machine`

```
$ docker-machine version
docker-machine version 0.6.0, build e27fb87
```

### Step 1 - Start Docker Machine

Start the machine, using the `--virtualbox-memory` option to increase itâ€™s memory. I also recommend using the `--virtualbox-disk-size` option to increate it's disk size. I use 6000 MB to accommodate all the docker images and 40000 MB to allow for enough disk space.

```
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory "6000" --virtualbox-disk-size "40000" default

To see how to connect Docker to this machine, run: docker-machine env default
```

### Step 2 - Set Docker Machine Connection

Configure shell environment to connect to your new Docker instance

```
$ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
```

## Getting started

To get all docker containers up and running use:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:codecentric/event-driven-microservices-platform.git
$ cd event-driven-microservices-platform
$ docker-compose up
```

If you want to use your own Github repository for the EDMP configuration file and the Spring Cloud Config Server property files you have to change two lines in the docker-compose.yml. First, change the CONFIG_REPO environment variable for the edmp-config-server according to your needs:
```
  edmp-config-server:
    image: codecentric/edmp-config-server
    ports:
      - "18888:8888"
    networks:
      - prodnetwork
    environment:
      CONFIG_REPO: "https://github.com/codecentric/event-driven-microservices-platform-config.git"
```
Then, change the EDMP_CONFIG_URL environment variable for jenkins according to your needs:
```
  jenkins:
    image: codecentric/edmp-jenkins:0.1
    ports:
      - "18080:8080"
    links:
      - nexus:nexus
      - sonar:sonar
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /usr/local/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker
    environment:
      EDMP_CONFIG_URL: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecentric/event-driven-microservices-platform-config/master/edmp-project-configuration.json"
```


For local development build the local images first and start them using:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

## FAQ

### Having problems downloading docker images?

**Error:** Network timed out while trying to connect to https://index.docker.io/

**Solution**

```
# Add nameserver to DNS (probably need to do "sudo su" first)
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart the environment
$ docker-machine restart default

# Refresh your environment settings
$ eval $(docker-machine env default)
```
I also needed to do this inside the docker-machine:
```
$ docker-machine ssh default
$ echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
```


### No Internet Connection from Docker Container

```
# Login to Docker VM
$ docker-machine ssh default

# Run DHCP client
$ sudo udhcpc

# Restart docker process
$ sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart
```
